# Release Notes v0.1.1

## Highlights
- Swapped the Mystery Meat Burger's customer penalty from -30% â†’ -15% so you can tempt more diners into your... experiment.
- Confined corpses to the outdoor rubbish so nobody accidentally tidies away the evidence indoors.
- Taught the practice cats to show suspicion indicators via the LocalViewRouter postfix patch, because even training dummies deserve spooky vibes.
