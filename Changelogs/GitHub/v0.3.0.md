# Release Notes v0.3.0
## Highlights
- Rerouted corpse cleanup through the new Fully Loaded effect pipeline so yesterday's leftovers either settle in or get processed without the old GameData duct tape.
- Added an overnight flag system that respects the Persistent Corpses toggle while still letting staff mop up story-driven messes like blood splatters before breakfast.
- Centralised the mod version metadata and stamped the release as v0.3.0 so future menu specials are easier to season.
