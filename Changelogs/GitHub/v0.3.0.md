# Release Notes v0.3.0
## Highlights
- Rerouted corpse cleanup through the new Fully Loaded effect pipeline so yesterday's leftovers either settle in or get processed without the old GameData duct tape.
- Added an overnight flag system that respects the Persistent Corpses toggle while still letting staff mop up story-driven messes like blood splatters before breakfast.
- Centralised the mod version metadata and stamped the release as v0.3.0 so future menu specials are easier to season.

# Release Notes v0.2.0
## Highlights
- Rolled out the Persistent Corpses card so yesterday's regulars linger into the next shift for a little extra ambience.
- Added in-game sliders and toggles to let you mix audio volumes and switch specific unlock cards—like Persistent Corpses—without leaving the kitchen.
- Knocked the Special Sauce provider's shop price down to match the Steam announcement, a friendly discount for repeat suppliers.

# Release Notes v0.1.4
## Highlights
- Stocked a Manual Meat Grinder appliance you can buy early before upgrading it into the Automatic workhorse.
- Reimagined the Automatic Meat Grinder as the upgraded form, letting conveyor belts whisk the mince without extra babysitting.

# Release Notes v0.1.3
## Highlights
- Made sure alerted customers still cost you a life if they bolt outside, just like the hotfix on Steam—no more freebies for squeamish patrons.

# Release Notes v0.1.2
## Highlights
- Yanked the troublesome Colorblind+ bottle textures so the mod stops faceplanting on load for our accessibility-minded chefs.

# Release Notes v0.1.1
## Highlights
- Swapped the Mystery Meat Burger's customer penalty from -30% → -15% so you can tempt more diners into your... experiment.
- Confined corpses to the outdoor rubbish heap so you can haul them out back without accidentally binning evidence indoors.
- Taught the practice cats to show suspicion indicators via the LocalViewRouter postfix patch, because even training dummies deserve spooky vibes.

# Release Notes v0.1.0
## Highlights
- Debuted the suspicion indicator system with reactive visuals and stingers so every stolen bite feels deliciously risky.
- Served up the full Mystery Meat menu alongside unlock cards like Cautious Crowd and Messy Murder to set the restaurant's tone from day one.
