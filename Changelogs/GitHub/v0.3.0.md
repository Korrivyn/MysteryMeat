# Release Notes v0.3.0

## Highlights
- Migrated the legacy corpse cleanup logic to the Fully Loaded effect pipeline so illegal sights convert or persist using the new systems without relying on GameData hacks.
- Added a dedicated overnight flag system that respects the Persistent Corpses setting while letting blood splatters and other authored messes clean up between days.
- Centralised the mod version in code for easier future bumps and updated the release to v0.3.0.
