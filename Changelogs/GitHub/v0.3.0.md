# Release Notes v0.3.0

## Highlights
- Rerouted corpse cleanup through the new Fully Loaded effect pipeline so yesterday's leftovers either convert or stay put without the old GameData duct tape.
- Introduced an overnight flag system that respects the Persistent Corpses preference while letting staff mop up story-driven messes like blood splatters before breakfast.
- Centralised the mod version metadata and stamped the release as v0.3.0 so future menu updates are easier to season.
