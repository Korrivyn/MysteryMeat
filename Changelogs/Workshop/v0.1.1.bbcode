[h2]Highlights[/h2]
[list]
[*]Swapped the Mystery Meat Burger's customer penalty from -30% â†’ -15% so you can tempt more diners into your... experiment.
[*]Confined corpses to the outdoor rubbish so the indoor bins politely refuse any bodies you drag their way.
[*]Taught the practice cats to show suspicion indicators via the LocalViewRouter postfix patch, because even training dummies deserve spooky vibes.
