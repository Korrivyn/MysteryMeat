[h2]Highlights[/h2]
[list]
[*]Migrated the corpse cleanup workflow to the Fully Loaded effect pipeline so illegal sights upgrade or persist without legacy GameData patches.
[*]Added a runtime overnight flag system that honours the Persistent Corpses preference while still clearing authored messes like blood between days.
[*]Centralised the mod version metadata and bumped the release to v0.3.0 for simpler future maintenance.
