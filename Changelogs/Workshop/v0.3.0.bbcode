[*]Rerouted corpse cleanup through the new Fully Loaded effect pipeline so yesterday's leftovers either settle in or get processed without the old GameData duct tape.

[*]Centralised the mod version metadata and stamped the release as v0.3.0 so future menu specials are easier to season.

[h2]Highlights[/h2]
